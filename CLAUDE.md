# cc-safe Project Instructions

## Syncing Documentation

When updating **README.md**, always check if the **help command** in `bin/cc-safe.js` (the `HELP_TEXT` constant) needs to be updated as well. The two should stay in sync.

Key sections that should match:
- Severity level descriptions
- Usage examples
- CLI options
